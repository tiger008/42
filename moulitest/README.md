# Moulitest: Test your 42 projects

<img align="right" height="230" src="http://i.imgur.com/3p0Xg7Z.png">

This repository contains tests for several projects done at 42.

Tested 42 projects:

* libft
* get_next_line
* ft_ls
* ft_printf (new)

Feedbacks, github issues and pull requests are welcome.

## Quick Start
Create the config file

	cp config.ini.template config.ini

Edit the config file

	vim config.ini # add your configs

Run tests
	
	make

## Advanced use
Run only some tests

	make ft_ls tests=<regexp>
	# e.g. To launch only the test 05 you can use
	make ft_ls tests=^05

GNL

* If the tests stop in the middle, it could mean that your get_next_line is waiting for an input from the file descriptor but nothing is coming.

The test framework and many libft tests are based on the work done by Maxime Bacoux (mbacoux).
